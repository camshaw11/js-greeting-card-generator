Pseudocode steps Cameron Shaw

1) access data from the form
 - grab form element
 - access form element value
 - send values to variable/ console.log

2) add an event listener and big function around all the code so it is wrapped and only executes once the submit button has been hit

3) prevent the default action of submitting data for the button so that the functions will run first

4) create a set of variables for each from option to grab the required id (using a dom query)

5) start creating smaller functions for each form option
 - create an if statement inside each function to change the class names in the html when a certain option is selected in the option set

5.5) use Jquery method or Vanilla js to manipulate the class names without touching the html

6) invoke functions

7) console log and dir the variables and values to make sure they are being registered. 

8) comment/ grid code
